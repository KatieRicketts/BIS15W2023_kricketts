6. Copy the files for today's lab from the class repository and paste them into **your** repository.  
7. Open today's lab in RStudio.  

## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. What are the characteristics of `tidy` data?  
columns = variables
rows = observations
cells = values

2. What is the difference between `select` and `filter`? 
select = isolate specific columns/variables (select has a c for column)
filter = isolate specific values within a variable (filter has an r for row)

3. When is your first midterm?  
tuesday, the 31st

## Warm-up
1. Load the bison data.
2. What are the dimesions and structure of the data?
3. We are only interested in code, sex, weight, year of birth. Restrict the data to these variables and store the dataframe as a new object.
4. Pull out the animals born between 1980-1990.
5. How many male and female bison are represented between 1980-1990?
6. Between 1980-1990, were males or females larger on average?
